# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 15, Saturday

***Today's Progress***: I finished the jQuery path on FreeCodeCamp. I completed my tribute page for the Front End Development challenge.

***Thoughts***: I started FreeCodeCamp less than 1 week ago, starting on Sunday, April 9th.

### Day 2: April 16, Sunday

***Today's Progress***: I started working on the Portfolio page for FreeCodeCamp. I created the navigation bar and the first section of the page.

***Thoughts***: This was very tough to fit in the hour with the work that had to be done, very glad I got to it though.

### Day 3: April 17, Monday

***Today's Progress***: Worked on the Portfolio page until Codepen went down. Did 2 Algorithm challenges at @freeCodeCamp until it came back up.

***Thoughts***: HINT: don't initialize the return value of a factorial to 0, it just multiplies everything by 0!

### Day 4: April 18, Tuesday

***Today's Progress***: Changed the CSS to center items on my page. Changed my portrait to be inline with my About text. Created social media shortcuts

***Thoughts***: The hardest part about web design is trying to get the look just the way you want it but also get it apealing to ohter people

### Day 5: April 19, Wednesday

***Today's Progress***: Put some final touches on the Portfolio page. It's going to grow thanks to @FreeCodeCamp. Still a little rough around the edges, but not terribly bad.

***Thoughts***: The UX/UI is still rough around the edges. I think the color scheme is alright, but it's a bit bland.

### Day 12: April 30, Sunday

***Today's Progress***: Started on the Weather App

***Thoughts***: Codepen may not be the best for using API's. I am switching this to github.io.

### Day 16: May 5, Friday

***Today's Progress***: Started on the Wikipedia Viewer App after finishing the weather app

***Thoughts***: Documenation is the hardest part of this or any other tech related job. I hopefully will get better. I hopefully can get back on track with this log file.

### Day 17: May 6, Saturday

***Today's Progress***: Got the JSON from the opensearch API of Wikipedia to return data. Got the basic function setup to return the data and display it to HTML

***Thoughts***: The JSON returned something similar to ["search",["title"],["description"],["link"]. After thinking about this for a day I realized that the array is an array of arrays, so we can use standard [0][1][2][3] to get the data. Need to finish up formatting and looks tomorrow. Also, need to test on mobile.

### Day 20: May 12, Saturday

***Today's Progress***: Setup the CSS and HTML layout for the Twitch app from FreeCodeCamp. Started working on the JSON but the status of the streams is inconsistent

***Thoughts***: The return is consistent, but the data is not.
