### Day 2: April 16, Sunday

***Today's Progress***: I started working on the Portfolio page for FreeCodeCamp. I created the navigation bar and the first section of the page.

***Thoughts***: This was very tough to fit in the hour with the work that had to be done, very glad I got to it though.

### Day 3: April 17, Monday

***Today's Progress***: Worked on the Portfolio page until Codepen went down. Did 2 Algorithm challenges at @freeCodeCamp until it came back up.

***Thoughts***: HINT: don't initialize the return value of a factorial to 0, it just multiplies everything by 0!

### Day 4: April 18, Tuesday

***Today's Progress***: Changed the CSS to center items on my page. Changed my portrait to be inline with my About text. Created social media shortcuts

***Thoughts***: The hardest part about web design is trying to get the look just the way you want it but also get it apealing to ohter people

### Day 5: April 19, Wednesday

***Today's Progress***: Put some final touches on the Portfolio page. It's going to grow thanks to @FreeCodeCamp. Still a little rough around the edges, but not terribly bad.

***Thoughts***: The UX/UI is still rough around the edges. I think the color scheme is alright, but it's a bit bland.
