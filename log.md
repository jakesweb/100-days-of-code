### Day 1: April 15, Saturday

***Today's Progress***: I finished the jQuery path on FreeCodeCamp. I completed my tribute page for the Front End Development challenge.

### Day 2: April 16, Sunday

***Today's Progress***: I started working on the Portfolio page for FreeCodeCamp. I created the navigation bar and the first section of the page.

***Thoughts***: This was very tough to fit in the hour with the work that had to be done, very glad I got to it though.

### Day 2: April 17, Monday

***Today's Progress***: Worked on the Portfolio page until Codepen went down. Did 2 Algorithm challenges at @freeCodeCamp until it came back up.

***Thoughts***: HINT: don't initialize the return value of a factorial to 0, it just multiplies everything by 0!
