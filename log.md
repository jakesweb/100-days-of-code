# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 15, Saturday

***Today's Progress***: I finished the jQuery path on FreeCodeCamp. I completed my tribute page for the Front End Development challenge.

***Thoughts***: I started FreeCodeCamp less than 1 week ago, starting on Sunday, April 9th.

### Day 2: April 16, Sunday

***Today's Progress***: I started working on the Portfolio page for FreeCodeCamp. I created the navigation bar and the first section of the page.

***Thoughts**: This was very tough to fit in the hour with the work that had to be done, very glad I got to it though.
