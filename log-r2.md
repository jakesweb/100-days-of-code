# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 8, 2020 Wednesday

***Today's Progress***: Setup the logic to take an article written and store it in the GraphQL API. Hardest part was getting the JSON output of the tags string to an array.

***Thoughts***: The logic behind GraphQL is really elegant but can be confusing. Realized that by submitting the mutation with the Apollo client it puts it all in JSON. Had to get the tags string out of the JSON and then convert it to an array to be correctly stored.

### Day 2: January 9, 2020 Thursday

***Today's Progress***: Wrote a blog article about how I got React hooks working with Apollo

***Thoughts***: I hope the article is helpful to some. I know I struggled with getting this working for a bit.

### Day 3: January 13, 2020 Monday

***Today's Progress***: Had to take a break while working extreme hours over the weekend. Started the work of adding Material-UI to the front-end to see if I could make the flow better.

***Thoughts***: Taking a break was hard, but with working 3 12 hours days Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, there was no choice.

### Day 34: January 14, 2020 Tuesday

***Today's Progress***: Fixed the tags function by using .map() instead of forEach. Working with Material-UI still to get sytling right.

***Thoughts***: Sitting back and taking a different approach may be the thing needed sometimes.
