# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 8, 2020 Wednesday

***Today's Progress***: Setu the logic to take an article written and store it in the GraphQL API. Hardest part was getting the JSON output of the tags string to an array.

***Thoughts***: The logic behind GraphQL is really elegant but can be confusing. Realized that by submitting the mutation with the Apollo client it puts it all in JSON. Had to get the tags string out of the JSON and then convert it to an array to be correctly stored.
